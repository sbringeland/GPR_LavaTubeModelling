# GPR_LavaTubeModelling
Files and code for forward and inverse-modelling of GPR detection of buried lunar lava tubes.
So far there is only a single script associated with this repository and it generates input files for gprMax based on a range of input parameters. In the future, I'll update this file with notes about other files, but for now it's just the one.
